        <p class = "p1">
          It belongs to the group of domesticated, or tame, birds called poultry. Chickens have short wings and a heavy body. This makes it hard for them to fly very far. Male chickens are called roosters. Chickens love to play, run, skip and flap their wings. They also enjoy sunbathing. Hens teach sounds to their chicks while they are still in the egg. Chickens have a profound memory and are able to distinguish between more than 100 faces of their species.

While the principal use of beef cattle is meat production, other uses include leather, and products used in shampoo and cosmetics.

Cows have brilliant eyesight, they can nearly see everything around them without moving their heads!

          Sushi
        </div>
        <p class = "p3">
          Sushi is a popular Japanese dish made from seasoned rice with fish, egg, or vegetables. Sushi comes from a Japanese word meaning "sour rice," and it's the rice that's at the heart of sushi. In the early days of sushi making, the rice used consisted of sour, fermenting rice that wrapped around aged fish only to help in creating umami, a distinct sour taste. After the fermentation finished, the rice was thrown out and only the fish was eaten.
